            <h2>Q. Who are you people?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. Fleeting Heartbeat Studios is a small, multinational team of Katawa Shoujo fans, some disabled and some not, looking to bring in players who can benefit the most from the KS experience. We are not affiliated with 4LS in any way.

            <h2>Q. Is this your first project?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. All of our members have experience working with visual novels in the past. KS:RE is our first project as a group, but it might not be our last.

            <h2>Q. Why rebuild the game?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. Katawa Shoujo was built on a version of Ren’Py released more than a decade ago. With all the new possibilities in Ren’Py 8, we saw an opportunity to implement accessibility and quality-of-life changes that simply weren’t possible at the time.

            <h2>Q. What will happen to KS:RE in the future?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. KS:RE is by no means a done deal! We still have ideas floating around that we can implement, and your suggestions will make a difference.

            <h2>Q. Do you accept merge requests?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. Community-made improvements are always welcome. We will of course assess anything sent our way, but as a general rule, yes.

            <h2>Q. Does KS:RE support save files from the original KS?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. Sadly no, the two versions are too different in terms of code for that to be possible. We suggest use a macro to skip through the parts you’ve already read.

            <h2>Q. How do I get in touch?</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>
            A. We have a public Discord server! Fleeting Heartbeat Studios members are tagged with their own role, and since we’re spread across the world, there should usually be at least one of us online. We all speak English, and most of us speak at least one other language. Do keep in mind that English is not the first language of every member, though. The server can be found at
            <a class="underline font-bold text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://discord.gg/49t4CVJNrt">here</a> For other inquiries, email us at <a  class="underline font-bold text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="mailto://staff@fhs.sh">staff@fhs.sh</a>.
