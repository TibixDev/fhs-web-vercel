# Running Katawa Shoujo on the Steam Deck with library integration

Greetings!

You might have already discovered that both KS and KS:RE is available to download via Flathub / Discovery - which is awesome! The Steam Deck and Linux in general has become greatly popular in the past few years, meaning more possible fans for the game but more possible question towards installation as well. *How can I make the game run on my Steam Deck? Would controller inputs work with it? What about adding it to my Steam library with illustrations?*
Here, in this guide I will present an easy and quick flow of installing, adding to the library, and decorating your beloved Katawa Shoujo client in just a few minutes. Not only that but this solution can also be applied to any other non-Steam game as well. I really hope that this article will bring sunshine to all of your concerns without the use of open *windows*. Cough...

First step is to buy and __own a Steam Deck__, obviously. :D

I assume you have already set up your console, got to know it at least on a basic level, et cetera.

__Change to Desktop mode and head to Flatpak / Discover.__ It should already be pinned to your taskbar. __Search Katawa Shoujo: Re-engineered and download it.__ (A copy of the original app is also available if you are interested in playing that version instead.)

> [https://flathub.org/apps/com.katawa_shoujo.KatawaShoujo](https://flathub.org/apps/com.katawa_shoujo.KatawaShoujo) | KS (Unofficial Port)<br>

Head to Steam and __add KS/KSRE as a Non-Steam game.__ | *Bottom-left corner => you can easily find the KS/KSRE app among all the other installed apps. Its name is easily recognizable. ; )*

Now we have the KS/KSRE app attached to the Steam launcher, great!
It’ll also appear inside the Game Launcher so no worries.

We need two things to prepare. The first one is __Decky__ and the other is the __asset we’d like to apply__ to the game inside Steam.

Install Decky, it will automatically add itself to your Game Launcher. Let’s just jump there once we are done installing. Press the triple-dot button on your console and scroll to the option at the very bottom. Here you can download multiple plugins to Decky. For the current occasion you’ll need a plugin called SteamGridDB. Head back to KS/KSRE. Click then go to its options. There’ll be an option called “Change Artwork”. There you can add every customization for the app inside Steam, including horizontal grid (Wide Capsule).

As for running the game, the team has already added controller input compatibility so it will not be necessary to only rely on touching the screen to progress. Though we can not guarantee that it works the same way as for the original version of the game.
While not the case with KS/KSRE, because it natively runs on Linux, if any other Windows visual novel has issues running try to load it with different a Proton version. | *Select Game on Steam => Properties => Compatibility => "Force the use of specific Steam Play compatibility tool" => Select a different Proton version, preferably Experimental or the newest versions / Proton GE if you have it*

Have fun decorating! :D
